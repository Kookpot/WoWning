    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What information do we collect?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may collect personally identifiable information from you in a variety of ways, including through online forms for ordering products and services, and other instances where you are invited to volunteer such information, including, but not limited to, when you register on our site, place an order or subscribe to our newsletter.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do we use your information for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any of the information we collect from you may be used to personalize your experience, improve our website, improve customer service, process transactions, send periodic emails. The email address you provide for order processing will only be used to send you information and updates pertaining to your order.

&lt;p&gt;We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) will not be stored on our servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Payments and refunds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Site offers products and services for sale. The Site does not handle payments for these products directly but rather refers these payments to a secure third-party payment processor which handles all aspects of the payment process.

Once we have been notified by the payment processor that a payment has been made, and that the payment has successfully passed a fraud review, access will be granted to the product or service being purchased as soon as possible, however, we make no guarantees of timeliness or immediacy. Free accounts are provided with limited access to the Site that allows the user to test all available services prior to making a payment and determine if the offered services meet users needs. You may request a refund within 7 days of the payment only if your browser does not support javascript and you're not able to use our policy generator, otherwise, no refunds will be offered. Note that our system keeps track of your browser name, version and javascript support so we will verify each request for legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibility of website visitors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By operating the Site, the Operator does not represent or imply that it endorses any or all of the contributed content, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful or non-harmful.

The Site may contain content that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable, as well as content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other errors. The Operator disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from the use by visitors of the Site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do we disclose any information to outside parties?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information, except to provide products or services you've requested. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copyright infringement and DMCA policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, we use cookies (which are small pieces of information that your browser stores on your computer's hard drive) to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart, understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors.
